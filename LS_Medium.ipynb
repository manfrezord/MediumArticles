    "Did you know that linear regressions are actually orthogonal projections? Whether you knew this or not you might want to read this article. It has a simple explanation for this and it also has some nice pictures! The code that is written below was used to generate some plots where a point in space is projected onto a plane formed by 2 vectors. This is similar to taking 3 data points and finding 2 linear regression coefficients that best fit those points. Before going through this code, it is better to read first the article."
